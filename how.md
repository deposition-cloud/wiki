- [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) for dockerized applications
- [Sandstorm App Market](https://apps.sandstorm.io/) for data-centric collaborative apps
- maybe VM images via [KubeVirt](https://kubevirt.io/)
- [Golem Network](https://golem.network/) and similar blockchainy stuff for decentralized distributed resource sharing
