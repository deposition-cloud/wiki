A few sets of design principles can be used to guide the core architectural decisions for the personal cloud.

## Human Needs Oriented[^1]

The system needs to support:

- Food production
- Energy capture and management
- Clean water
- Shelter
- Waste management
- Sewage treatment

A context-aware system that doesn't create negative externalities is by definition sustainable, aka "can go on forever".
