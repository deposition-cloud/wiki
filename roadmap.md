# Roadmapping

## To Do

- [ ] Research wiki-based workflows
  - [ ] Find better tools

## Big Ideas

- Embed forward-looking review to keep remembering useful stuff - future active recall
- Mix wiki, docs, dynalist, zigzag, and persistent chat
  - Chat:
    - Use transcript from Keybase to pin new knowledge against
- Integrate dynamic documents
  - D3
  - ObservableHQ
    - Visualize chat history from Keybase
  - Jupyter Notebooks
  - Transclusion
- Future-trigger reminders to mediate forgetting curve
- SSO with Auth0
- Graph database and visualisation
  - GraphQL endpoint to traverse data
  - Neo4j for querying and analysing
- Cross-link against other personal clouds
- Personalize by addressing core lifestyle needs with data and knowledge
  - Knowledge creation, review and editing
    - With a social dimension, friends, family, community, remote experts
  - Data-fact-first
  - AI driven
  - Code-oriented, like https://mimix.io/
- Observability-first, debugable
  - Build dashboards to understand the underlying complexity (CPU, networking, knowledge, socialization)
  - Behaviour-driven - what tests to write
- Where to draw the line between private data, shareable data, and public data
  - How not to mix and make mistakes
- Plan transition to blockchains-based infrastructure once that matures
  - IPFS, maidsafe
  - IOTA for home IoT
  - Ethereum for inter-cloud contracts
    - Smart contract aggregate and tender collective data
- Cross-compare 2+ personal clouds to understand similarities
- Predict-download wiki articles for local storage and spaced-rep review
  - Track number of times clicked through links like in Discourse
    - Allow disabling of social cues to help focus on the content alone
- @mention users of other clouds, and send them emails/notifications a la [mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/)
  - AuthN/Z model?

## Future Milestones

- [ ] Setup several clouds in parallel to motivate upfront automation investment
  - [ ] Find a friend
  - [ ] MtlGreen
  - [ ] Parents
- [ ] Create/find collaborators
