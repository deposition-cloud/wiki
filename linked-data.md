# How to link data?

First, we need to understand the [services we use online](cloud-services)

The reason we use them is because they are convenient, usable, and useful.

Is there a way to rely on familiar UX innovations, yet still protect our privacy?

Imagine:

- Keep using the awesome-UX tools already available
  - e.g.: Google Keep has a team of full-time UX designers focused on a creating a flawless note taking experience
    - yet the data is data is difficult to access [^1]
- Save the data in our personal cloud
