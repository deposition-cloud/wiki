# Systems

We can think of a tree as the intersection of several systems
- the sun
- the earth
- the atmosphere
- the genes

Where these systems intersect and photosynthesis takes place, that's where we usually find a tree.

For your life on the web, a few elements needs to fall into place all at the same time:
- electricity
- network
- other servers
- a program
- the physical device and all the logistics required to get it to your hands
- you knowing how to operate the machine

When these systems intersectâ€”and they do so reliably well for billions of people and smart thingsâ€”that's where data gets created from human and sensor inputs and starts to flow through the internet.

## Your Data

"your" = not just yours alone, remember, privacy is a collective construct[^1]

- financial data
  - your banks, credit cards, credit reporting agencies, and [Mint](https://mint.intuit.com/)
- psychometric data
  - introverted or not, political affiliation, Big5
- physical activity
  - geolocation, noise level, speed of device, uber
- relationships
  - sms, persistent chats like slack, work emails, public transit use, frequency of interaction with your contacts, all can be semantically analysed
- passwords
  - hardware wallets for crypto, signal-like e2e encryption, entropy sources
- health data
  - heart rate variability, galvanic skin response, blood oxigenation, voice timbre (if you cough, a smart assistant can pick up if you have covid), your DNA, from consumer health to ER-level

Still, [you have a lot of power](https://www.nirandfar.com/social-dilemma-review/) with respect to how you[^1] present yourself to these organizations and foreign individuals, their systems and AIs.

While *they* are big (some hackers are just individuals), well coordinated, and extremely well informed. They, of course, are made of us - so we too can operate with at least as much tact.

If you're working for one of these data behemothsâ€”and most of us are in some direct way supporting their activitiesâ€”you are entertaining a strange socio-technical dynamic that doesn't scale well with freedom and privacy, some call it [surveilance capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_capitalism).

## The Opportunity

Attempting a solution.

Other than outright banning the selling of personal data, how about resisting the current system and setting yourself up for success to "leak less" personal data?

Let's assume the healthcare establishment and the banks got their priorities straight and are going to protect you and your data because they have a [fiduciary duty](fiduciary-duty) to do so.

All others we need to be more careful with.

So what can we do to protect each others' privacy, freedom, and future?

1. One good strategy is to **trust the math**, of course, that requires you to understand the math, and that takes time and study. In software, that means at least being able to read the source code. In hardware, that means being able to see how it's made, and ideally audit the entire supply chain.
2. Failing that, you could **trust someone that trusts the math**. Ideally they have a fiduciary duty to you.
3. Failing that, say you don't trust the math (or you don't trust yourself to trust the math), you could still **trust the organization and individuals with a fiduciary duty to you** because they are kept accountable by other socio-technical mechanisms.
4. Then, maybe we can think of an explicit collective contract that protects us in large numbers, say an insurance scheme, or a ðŸ“º[crypto cliff](https://youtu.be/3jPYk7ucrjo) setup.

This entire collective personal cloud set of projects is about moving up this list, and still maintaining an enjoyable life to live.

Another solution would be to behave differently predictably online, say with the help of a bot that clicks on different things for you in the background while you surf the web, and generates garbage data for all these spies, which would increase their cost for them to make sense of who you are and what you're about to do. Having a prior agreement to have all your contacts install this "deflector" could pollute the big data databases with enough noise. Beware though that [AIs can now detect deepfakes](https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/detect-fakes/overview/).

## The Specifics

I regularly use:

- linkedin.com "connections" and news, facebook.com friends and communities, and lots of chatting with a few people
- google.com a Chromebook, and an Android phone, so that's everything from GPS coordinates I share with friends in real-time (all the time), to years of Gmail, to Google Home Assistant questions
- github.com and gitlab.com
- tangerine.ca, VISA, and MasterCard, manulife.com, and wealthsimple.com
- dialogue.co and the Quebec and Canadian Health system
- a windows laptop from dell.com
- all the nearby shops I buy food and stuff from
- amazon.com for non-local purchases
- slack.com for volunteering and open source communications, now owned by salesforce.com[^2]
- canfone.com ISP which resells [Bell](https://www.bell.ca/) and [Videotron](https://videotron.com/)
- intel.com root certificates and all its suppliers to not have been supply-chain hacked and embedded an expensive chip
- all other internet connected devices that pass through my home, like friends' mobiles, smartfridges and lights

â€¦and 800+ other web properties that I know of, that [1Password](https://1password.com/) tells me I have an account for. 1Password isn't open source, but it is Canadian ðŸ˜„â€”which is not a good enough reason re: [Five Eyes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes)

Any one of these operations being better capitalized than myself. ðŸ’¯

Nonetheless, we are many individuals and communities out there, so I'm not worried about our collective ability to coordinate a resilient defense.

## Trust but Verify

Now, who and what do I rely on to protect our privacy, freedom and future?

- some of the above companies, more specifically, prospective whistle-blowers working at these organizations[^3]
- Edward Snowden, torproject.org, and wikileaks.com
- my neighbours to keep being nice to me, though I got my bike stolen this summer, from my balcony(!)
- nic.cz [Turris Omnia](https://www.turris.com/en/omnia/overview/) router to help me spot any spying devices that I'm not aware of
- the local police to not abuse its power, keeping in mind to [not talk to the police](https://youtu.be/d-7o9xYp7eE?t=177) for whatever reason
- drapes on my windows
- the open source movement[^4]

[^1] When I upload a photo of you and me to Facebook, I share a lot of personal details about both (location, looks and mood that day, [Exif](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exif) metadate, timing of post and unpredictable comments from other people who might further lead details about the activity photographed). The data is now being packaged, sliced, and diced, and sold to highest bidders
